# PartyUp
An application where you and those close to you can choose to share and keep track of each other on a Google Map!

Want to plan an event for everyone to meet at, plan an event and pin the location so everyone knows where to meet.
Did you all choose to meet up for some ice-cream half an hour away? No one else is there yet? Check where they are at on the map.
At a concert with a friend and they haven't gotten back from the bathroom yet? Check the app, if they are suspiciously far away, you can hit the panic button to ring their phone to see if they're okay. In the worst case scenario, you can forward their GPS info to the local authorities to assist!
